Libraries need to be placed in a "libs/" directory in order for the 
project to compile correctly. 

Collider is dependent on a LibGDX jar file (see 
http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html). This dependence is 
minimal and may be unnecessary in a future version of Collider. 

Binaries to be placed in libs/:
 * gdx.jar
 
Source code to be placed in libs/:
 * gdx-sources.jar
