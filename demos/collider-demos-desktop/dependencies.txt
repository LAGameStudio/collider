Libraries need to be placed in a "libs/" directory in order for the 
project to compile correctly.

Collider-demos-desktop is dependent on some LibGDX jar files (see 
http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html).

Binaries to be placed in libs/:
 * gdx-backend-lwjgl.jar
 * gdx-backend-lwjgl-natives.jar
 * gdx-natives.jar
 
Source code to be placed in libs/:
 * gdx-backend-lwjgl-sources.jar
